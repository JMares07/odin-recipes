        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Seriously, have you ever been served escargot outside of a restaurant? Impress your friends with this dish.</p>        
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Escargot</li>
            <li>Shells(optional)</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Shallot</li>
            <li>Good Butter(important)</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>White Wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Remove butter from the fridge and allow it to soften to room temperature.Open the can of escargot and drain out the liquid.Allow the escargot to sit in the strainer for a few minutes to remove more liquid.Meanwhile, peel and finely mince about 10 cloves of garlic. When you think you've minced it enough, mince it even more. This should take a while.Finely dice/mince a small shallot as small as you can, but don't macerate the shallot.Remove parsley leaves from the stems. Pinch them into a tight stack and slice, then mince until parsley is in "flake" or "dust" texture.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, add softened butter, garlic, shallot, parsley, white wine, salt, and pepper.Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly mix butter together. An electric mixture could be used for this, but it is absolutely not necessary.</li>
            <li>Use a small spoon or a teaspoon measure to scoop out the base layer of butter.Whether using shells or an escargot plate, add one scoop to the vessel.Then, top with a drained escargot, then add another scoop on top. You may need to use your fingers to press it down, as the escargot should be covered in butter.If you are using just a baking dish and no shells or escargot dish, you'll want to use roughly 1 cup of garlic butter for 24 snails. (2 teaspoons times 24 = 1 cup).Bake in a 400ยบ F oven for 10-12 minutes.The garlic should no longer be raw, and the edges of the butter should begin to brown.Remove from oven and cool slightly, then enjoy!</li>
